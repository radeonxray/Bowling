### Incomplete Work and minor thoughts

* General
    * Assignment is far from complete, which I'm not happy or satisfied with, at all.
    * Not keeping in line with SOLID principles
    * Java Application with Maven Framework, for quick and easy access to new libraries and dependencies.
    * Code should be generally well-commented, perhaps too much.
    
* Bowling Score
    * Not working 100% as intended
    * The project does not present a "true" algorithm, right now, it's more functions and methods.
    * Code is (as of this writing) is not very nice
    * While some attempts might provided successful results, there are still an unknown amount of cases and scenarios, that needs to be handled and managed.

* Retrieve Data
    * Application is able to fetch the data with no issues.
    * The Data is managed and converted for better handling with OOP.
    * Though the application is capable of retrieving the data, I'm not satisfied with the way I'm converting the data to a manageable Object, mainly due to the choice of JSON-library
    
* Send Data
    * The functionality for sending data has been build.
    * Only missing work needed, is testing sending actual data and results.
         
* Test
    * JUnit 5.4 was chosen for the project 
    * Did not complete any major or minor testing of the actual program
